# dioxuslabs.com

This repository contains the source code for the https://dioxuslabs.com website. 

This website is written with Dioxus, pre-generated with `dioxus_ssr`, and then rehydrated with interactivity provided by `dioxus_web`.

## Development

Using trunk:

```
trunk serve
```


The documentation can be edited using any text editor. Most commonly used editors support syntax highlighting for the `markdown` format. To view your changes you can install the [dioxus-cli] tool locally, assuming you already have a working `Rust` setup;
```console
> cargo install dioxus-cli
```

With [dioxus] installed you can use it to build and serve the documentation on your local system;
```console
> dixous develop --example spa
```

this will start a local server that will be available on [localhost](http://localhost:3000) and will automatically build and re-build the documentation when it changes.
